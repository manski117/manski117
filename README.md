## Hi there 👋 I'm Mike
### Developer 🖥️, Designer 🖌️, Educator 📚, Scientist 🔬, Gamer 🎲, Backpacker :basecamp:, Fencer ⚔️ and Amateur Astronomer 🔭.
I'm Mike and I'm a self-taught developer. I'm primarily full stack JavaScript/Typescript NodeJS/NextJS, Python, SQL, Django, but my programming experience also includes PHP, Java, C#/.NET, and various content management systems. My passion for programming began in graduate school when I was working as a graduate student at the University of Georgia studying the genetic underpinnings of neurodevelopmental disorders in animal models. I taught myself how to code in Python to write my own programs to assist in primer design, DNA cloning, and even some AI image detection in collaboration with Computer Science colleagues. Ever since then, I've been hooked on learning how to think programmatically to solve difficult problems, or create tools that are useful for hobby communities that I'm passionate about.

#### 🧠 Proudly Neurodivergent
I believe that diversity helps our world to be more creative, as it takes all types of brains to imagine solutions to the universe's infinite challenges and problems. My ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder does not make me lesser, but they instead empower me. I am always happy and eager to work on any team that embraces diversity, free-thinking, and neurodivergence.
